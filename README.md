# Functional Programming with Javascript 

This is a basic express application written using the functional programming paradigm. The app consumes the NASA API in order to fetch the most recent information about one of three rovers, located on Mars. Based on the rover selected, the app displays the most recent photos taken by that rover as well as important information about the rover and its mission.

## Getting Started

1. run npm start
2. select rover
3. view images and rover info
